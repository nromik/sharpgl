//	This class is a new type of primitive (specifically it's a SceneObject).
//	It demonstrates how to draw a large number of points very quickly, using the
//	same draw styles for each one. It would be added to the custom primitives in the 
//	scene. 

//	Every point has the same attributes, they are set at the beginning of the drawing
//	process. Edit the pointAttributes member and you change how the points are drawn.

//	The points are stored as a raw float array, not as an array of say, Point classes,
//	or an array of vertices. Points is designed to be very fast and memory efficient.
//	Although a raw float array is old fasioned, it is significantly faster. However, 
//	I've named it pointsRaw to make it explicit that it's NOT an array of vertices.

//	This class is interactable (the interactable code is *sweet*, by simply deriving
//	from the interactive interface you automatically have the functionaility to move, 
//	scale, rotate etc your points. A smoother way might be to override DrawInteractable
//	and draw a 'widgit' in the centre of the the field, i.e a handle to move it around 
//	with.
