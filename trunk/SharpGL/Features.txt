MATERIALS

	*	Materials are fully integrated into the Persistence Engine. Textures can be
		loaded to and from bmp, png, gif, jpg and tif images.
		Materials themselves can be saved as *.sfm (SharpFroce Materials) files, on
		their own or as a collection.
		
	*	The MaterialListViewItem class allows you to insert materials into a list view,
		automatically creating previews etc.
