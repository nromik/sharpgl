What SharpGL Needs

*	Bring in all the new functions and definitions from OpenGL 2.1 - shaders, new buffers etc.

*	Update texture code so that resizing an image resises to a power of two found 
	by getting the MSB of a number e.g 
	00010110
	   |
	   Most Significant bit (8).
	   
	OpenGL 2.1 has no need for power of two textures.
	   
*	Change camera drawing code so a display list that draws a camera shape is executed
	and the view volume is changed.
	
***	OpenGL should be able to return any attribute group with the CURRENT attribute
	settings, this would make it easier to use, e.g 
	
	LightingAttributes light = gl.LightingAttributes;
	light.enabled = false;
	light.Set(gl);
	...
	light.Restore(gl);
	
	It would also allow for easier SharpForce specific attributes, e.g. 
	void Set(OpenGL gl)
	{
		LightingAttributes previous  = gl.LightingAttributes;
		...
	}
	void Restore(OpenGL gl)
	{
		previous.Set(gl);
	}
	
	Without having to use the matrix stack.
